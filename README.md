# Stock Market Forecasting using LSTM and GRU

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks. The project aims to forecast future stock prices based on historical data and compare the performance of LSTM and GRU models in terms of prediction accuracy and loss.
